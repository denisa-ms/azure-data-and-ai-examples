    "### DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "    This example shows how to retrieve data from Azure SQL DB by using Open AI GPT.  \n",
    "    Asking questions in plain english that gets \"translated\" by GPT into SQL.\n",
    "    Using Langchain SQLDatabaseChain \n",
    "### REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "    1. Create an Azure SQL DB and populate it with data.\n",
    "    2. Create an .env file in the root folder with the following variables:\n",
    "      SQL_SERVER=\"<server>\"\n",
    "      SQL_USER=\"<user>\"\n",
    "      SQL_PWD=\"<pwd>\"\n",
    "      SQL_DBNAME=\"<dbname>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample questions you can ask:\n",
    "      List the tables in the database\n",
    "      How many products are in the Adventure Works database?\n",
    "      How many Products are color black?\n",
    "      How many SalesOrderDetail are for the Product AWC Logo Cap ?\n",
    "      List the top 10 most expensive products\n",
    "      What are the top 10 highest grossing products in the Adventure Works database?\n",
    "\n",
    "### For more information about Langchain agent toolkits, see:\n",
