    "    This example shows how to create embeddings from urls and saves it in a faiss DB in the /dbs/urls/ folder\n",
    "    Then query these faiss index and get an answer using OpenAI GPT3.5\n",
    "### REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "    Create an .env file with your OpenAI API key and save it in the root directory of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For more information about Faiss index, see:\n",
