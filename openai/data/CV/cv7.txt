Oct 2016 - Jan 2018
After transferring internally to AWS Monitoring, I joined the CloudWatch Console UI
team who owned the the customer facing UI for AWS' metric and alarming service.
Below are some key moments:
â€¢ Adding the ability to hide autoscaling alarms (legacy gwt code) from the
alarms summary. This was a highly requested feature by AWS customers
â€¢ Adding the ability to specify any previous Console UI deployment frontend code to be executed against the checked-out version of the back-end
code (API). This was for backwards compatibility testing after a bad
deployment
â€¢ Owning and delivering the UI development of Metric Math, CloudWatch's
newest feature that allows metrics to me manipulated and normalised via
expressions - https://amzn.to/2HcTBwz
AMAZON
Software Development Engineer 1 |
Jun 2014 - Sep 2016
Upon first joining Amazon, I was a member of a team who developed several tools
used daily by Network Engineers to maintain (update, change, fix, etc.) the evergrowing Amazon network. Here are some personal highlights:
â€¢ Creating and owning a tool that allowed the updating of OS Firmware on
JUNOS devices in a hands-off manner
â€¢ Contributing to an org-wide push for automation (supervised automated
execution) implementing safety measures and auditing of changes to be
executed
â€¢ Designing, peer-reviewing, and building a web portal to aggregate the
many networking services into one over-arching view of the entire
network
â€¢ Driving adoption by talking to, and surveying, the most active users and
quickly iterating changes based on feedback. Now widely used among
Amazon Network Engineers

PROJECTS
ONENOTE.ME
Creator |
Jan 2020 - Feb 2020
I made this as I struggled with sharing deep links to OneNote in Slack and other
applications. OneNote links use a "onenote:" prefix that opens links in OneNote,
however this does not work with chat apps. Using OneNote.me solves this issue.
