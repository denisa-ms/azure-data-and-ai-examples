    "### DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "    This example shows how to create embeddings from \"Moby-Dick; or The Whale\" - a novel by Herman Melville in txt format and saves it in the /dbs/books/ folder to a FAISS index.\n",
    "    Then query these documents and get an answer using OpenAI GPT3.5 with chat\n",
    "### REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "    Create an .env file with your OpenAI API key and save it in the root directory of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For more information about Faiss index, see:\n",
